I got up at 6:45 am this morning and departs at 7:20, which means there's an interval of 35 minutes. Adequate preparing time ensures my stuffs is fully prepared, my mind is waken up(sober and less drossiness), and my mood is finer due to unhurry.

I'm convinced that around 6:45  is the perfect time for wake up. I think following sunrise is a good way of deferring to the biorhythm. so it falls to the conclusion that--
- set the waking up time varies by time, depending on the time of sunrise.
