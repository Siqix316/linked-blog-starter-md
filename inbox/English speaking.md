### **3C** three step memorizing vocab
#### Record
- valid input: do not need to know exactly spelling , but use it in oral communication *first record

- look up again *second record

- type and search relevant short videos *third record

- repeat *follow the curve of forgetting*
#### Retain
- contextual variability: 
	a. experience specific **scenarios** within the vocab; 
	*e.g. going to see the dermatologist*
	
	b. relate to certain objects in real life
	*e.g. The dermatologist prescribed you a medicine, every time you take the medicine, it reminds you of the word "dermatologist"

- visual memory is stronger than verbal memory
	*e.g. draw the inflammation onto your skin; play slide shows*

- writing down 
	*e.g. on flash cards; whiteboard; quizlet*
#### Retrieve
*wake the memory up
- distributed practice
	**1 minute
	1 hour
	1 day
	1 month
	1 year
	...**
